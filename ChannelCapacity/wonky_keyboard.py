Problem 5.17 page 87 of Biggs

A simplified keypad has four keys 
arranged in two rows of two. If the intention is to press key x, 
there is probability f of pressing the other key in the same row 
and probability f of pressing the other key in the same column 
(and consequently probability 1 âˆ’ 2f of pressing x). Write down 
the channel matrix for this situation and find its capacity 
(i.e. the maximum entropy, or information per symbol, that can 
be sent with this keyboard).

our keyboard is:

a  b
c  d

The 4 x 4 matrix is

P(y=a|x=a)  P(y=b|x=a)  P(y=c|x=a)  P(y=d|x=a)
P(y=a|x=b)  P(y=b|x=b)  P(y=c|x=b)  P(y=d|x=b)
P(y=a|x=c)  P(y=b|x=c)  P(y=c|x=c)  P(y=d|x=c)
P(y=a|x=d)  P(y=b|x=d)  P(y=c|x=d)  P(y=d|x=d)

We know that pressing the key correctly is p = 1 - 2f, so our diagonal will be that.
Likewise, their is a p = 0 chance of hitting a key not on the row or column, so the other diagonal will be zeros.
The remaining fields are keys adjacent to our intended key -- so they are p = f

1 - 2f    f     f    0
f     1 - 2f   0    f
f     0    1 - 2f   f
0    f     f   1 - 2f



This channel is symmmetric. We know then that the capacity must be at its max when each key is equally probable -- 1/4.

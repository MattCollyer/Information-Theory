##Started reading Shannon...

So far so good. Confused on a few places. I find his explanations for the 'non math-y' stuff to be very good and intuitive. However, I am getting confused on his proof examples and overall formula explanations. Variables might be explained pages ago and are seldom redefined... things like that.

Places of confusion:

formula derivation for channel capacity. Looking at the syllabus, we've set aside time for that in a later week. So maybe my confusion is OK for now. 


Entropy formula derivation. Much of it made sense to me, but I found myself getting a bit lost in his formal explanation in the appendix. Perhaps we can quickly go over that. I think it would be helpful if we went over the desired formula H() properties 1, 2 & 3. Furthermore, his explanation of entropy properties 3 and 5 were a bit confusing for me. I think it would be good if we went over them all in the next meeting.

 
I will update this soon, I have also spent some time refreshing myself on some general probability.
